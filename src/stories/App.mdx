# App.jsx
## the App.jsx file ties our component in to a full page application

We publish pages made from components that are tested in isolation from each other. In this case we are including the ComingSoon component in the `src/App.jsx` starting file that was created when we started our project. Replace the contents of `src/app.jsx` with:

```javascript
import { en } from './stories/ComingSoon.stories.jsx';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <ComingSoon {...en.args} />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

We are importing our en story and supplying it to our ComingSoon component.
