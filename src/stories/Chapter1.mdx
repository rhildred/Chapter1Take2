# Setting Up your training Environment
## and publishing your work on github and Cloudflare

Let's start with the big idea. Well 3 big ideas that I remember from school:
- embrace constraints
- don't reinvent the wheel
- change 1 thing at a time

If you arrived here from a Google search you should really buy the book, ["Object Oriented Javascript."](https://www.packtpub.com/product/object-oriented-javascript-third-edition/9781785880568) This storybook and github repository reinforce the chapter 1 concept of objects being reusable components of other objects. Following the, "Don't reinvent the wheel," principle from school. We will build and test a component in isolation and then consume our component in a page we can put on the internet. In future chapters of the book we go into more detail about the concepts involved building on the basic components of html for **content**, css for **presentation** and javascript for **behaviour**.
