# Setting Up your training Environment
## and publishing your work on github and Cloudflare

Let's start with the big idea. Well 3 big ideas that I remember from school:
- embrace constraints
- don't reinvent the wheel
- change 1 thing at a time

If you arrived here from a Google search you should really buy the book, "Object Oriented Javascript." This storybook and github repository reinforce the chapter 1 concept of objects being reusable components of other objects. Don't reinvent the wheel. We will build and test a component in isolation and then consume our component in a page we can put on the internet.
