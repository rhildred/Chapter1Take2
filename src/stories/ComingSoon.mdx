# Coming Soon

## ... is based very much on w3.css templates

I wanted to give you a quick win, but I also thought it would be fun to set a goal for finishing [the book](https://www.packtpub.com/product/object-oriented-javascript-third-edition/9781785880568). You can write Coming Soon stories in other languages by editing `src/stories/ComingSoon.stories.jsx`. Have a look at the story for french:

```javascript
export const fr = {
  args: {
    title: 'Bientôt disponible',
    tagline: (
      <h2>
        {' '}
        ... dans <DaysLeft readyDate="2023=09-05" /> jours
      </h2>
    ),
    backgroundImage: '/img/forestbridge.jpg',
    logo: 'Logo',
    footer: 'Alimenté par',
  },
};

```

<Canvas of={ComingSoonStories.fr} />

Of course you can also change your args for your own use case.

<StoryFooter href="/?path=/docs/components-1-2-app-jsx--docs" title="Add to App" tagline="add Coming Soon to App.jsx component" label="next" />
